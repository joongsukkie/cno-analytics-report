# First-wave feedback status

This checklist records what the report supports and what the operator does each month.

- [x] CNO wax seal centered on the report and used in the opening letter.
- [x] Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook/Meta, and other detected platforms appear as checkboxes.
- [x] Metrics, audience data, charts, and comparisons recalculate for the selected platform(s); one platform is selected by default, and a multi-platform selection renders separate platform KPI panels and charts instead of a blended engagement rate or funnel.
- [x] Multiple CSV selection and page-wide drag-and-drop.
- [x] Campaign tags and campaign comparison using robust medians.
- [x] Content-pillar tags and pillar comparison, with a visible count of untagged posts.
- [x] Daily, weekly, monthly, last-30-day, last-90-day, all-time, and custom date views.
- [x] Editable narrative, findings, recommendations, headline, and opening letter; edits persist in the browser.
- [x] Previous-report recommendation continuity when reports are created in the same browser.
- [x] Unique interactive report links, with optional client-side password protection.
- [x] Caption length is explicitly labeled as characters.
- [x] Audience section is separated by platform and expands when demographic fields are uploaded.
- [x] Website clicks, DMs, meaningful comments, comment replies, leads, bookings, memberships, retail sales, revenue, and event outcomes are recognized.
- [x] Current-versus-prior comparisons on headline, profile, content, and journey metrics.
- [x] Branded wax-seal envelope and letter introduction.
- [x] Paid/boosted data: spend, paid reach/impressions, paid clicks/follows/conversions/revenue, paid CTR, CPM, cost per paid click/follow/conversion, and ROAS. Paid efficiency never substitutes total organic-plus-paid outcomes.
- [x] Full uploaded dataset is available as a spreadsheet at the bottom and can be downloaded in normalized form.
- [x] Visualization-first success scorecard covering authority, audience quality, campaign momentum, and business growth, with optional per-metric monthly targets and progress-to-goal bars (`<metric>_target` columns).
- [x] Formula-matched platform benchmark context, with warnings against blending platforms or mismatching engagement-rate denominators; client-specific peer norms can replace the reference.
- [x] CNO website styling—including typography, color, fine rules, editorial layouts, and “Hand it over” upload action.
- [x] Report leads with the story and the client's goals (the summarized, plain-language view) before the detailed data.
- [x] Optional AI narrative: paste an OpenAI or Anthropic API key to rewrite the opening letter and takeaways from the client's real numbers. It includes structured evidence keys, confidence levels, sample-size rules, data-quality cautions, optional CNO context, and a CNO-only evidence review. Key stays in the browser only and never travels in a share link.
- [x] CNO-only data-quality audit and visibly separate **CNO workspace · staff tools** versus **Client report · view only** experiences.
- [x] Shared links are scoped to a single client's data and open view-only (no uploading, switching clients, editing, or export), so one client can never see another's results even if a password is mishandled.
- [x] Installable, offline-capable app (PWA): add to home screen or install on Mac/Windows/phone, and bookmark to return anytime.
- [x] Expanded paid vs. organic section: reach and impressions splits, paid share of reach, and an optional AI read on spend.

## Monthly refresh workflow

1. Export the required period from Rella and/or each native platform. Export account-level and post-level data when both are available.
2. Export attributable outcomes from the client’s operational systems when they matter: inquiries, bookings, memberships, event registrations/attendance, orders, and revenue.
3. Add `client`, `platform`, `campaign`, `campaign_phase`, and `pillar` columns where those labels are not already present. Do not alter the source metric columns.
4. Upload all files together. Select one platform at a time for platform-specific reporting, then select multiple only for an intentional portfolio view.
5. Choose the report period and chart detail. Sanity-check headline totals against the native platform for the same date range.
6. Edit the narrative where human context is required. The charts and calculations remain deterministic.
7. Create a new password-protected share link for that client and cycle. Send the password separately.

Manual CSV reporting still needs no API key or server database. A shared link is a self-contained encrypted snapshot, so refreshing manual source data requires creating a fresh link. The optional native-sync service is a separate CNO-only backend and is not exposed in client reports.
